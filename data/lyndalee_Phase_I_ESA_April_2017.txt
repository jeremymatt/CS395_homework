EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 
The Johnson Company, Inc., of Montpelier, Vermont was retained by the Rutland 
Regional Planning Commission (RRPC) to conduct a Phase I Environmental Site 
Assessment (ESA) of the Former Lynda Lee Site located at 10 Cleveland Avenue in 
Rutland, Vermont (the Site). The Site is listed as an active hazardous waste site (SMS 
#:2016-4670) with low priority. While the Site is listed as an active hazardous waste site, 
the site status is designated as “release not identified”. 
 
This ESA was performed by personnel from The Johnson Company (JCO) who meet the 
definition of Environmental Professional as defined in 40 CFR Part 312.  This ESA 
included reviewing existing documentation, available aerial photographs and topographic 
maps, determining the regulatory status of the Site, contacting appropriate personnel 
regarding past and present uses of the Site, investigating the potential for past releases of 
petroleum products and/or hazardous substances at the Site, and conducting a site 
reconnaissance to visually inspect accessible portions of the Site to ascertain the presence 
of recognized environmental conditions (RECs) in the form of present or potential 
release(s) of hazardous substances or petroleum products. In addition, the presence of 
historic recognized environmental conditions (HRECs) – a past release of hazardous 
substance(s) that has been addressed to residential use standards or unrestricted use 
criteria – and controlled recognized environmental conditions (CREC) – a past release of 
hazardous substance(s) that has been addressed to non-residential use standards and is 
subject to some type of control – at the Site.  As such, a HREC is no longer a REC when 
the remaining environmental conditions are compliant with the most current regulatory 
criteria; and a CREC is a REC. 
 
JCO understands that no environmental investigations, with the exception of asbestos 
inspections, have been conducted the Site. A Site reconnaissance was conducted by JCO 
on February 3, 2017 which included an inspection of interior and exterior portions of the 
Site.  Photographs of Site conditions during the reconnaissance are provided in Appendix 
8 of this report.   
 
JCO understands that The Housing Trust of Rutland County anticipates potential 
redevelopment of the Site and the findings of this assessment are intended to better 
inform future planning and development options.   
 
The Johnson Company has performed this Phase I ESA in conformance with the scope 
and limitations of ASTM Practice E-1527-13 of the Site in the City of Rutland, Vermont.  
Any exception to, or deletions from, this practice are described in Section 8.1 of this 
report.  This assessment has revealed no evidence of RECs or CRECs in connection with 
the property except for the following:  
 
RECS: 
 
1. Deposition of industrial-related pollutants to shallow soil: The Site and the areas 
immediately surrounding the Site were historically used for a variety of industrial 
activities including a foundry, machine shop, manufactured gas facility, lumber yard, 
offset printing (which may have utilized PCB containing inks), textile manufacturing, 
and railcar traffic. In addition, the Site was formerly heated using a coal-fired furnace 
and fuel oil. Industrial activities often involve the burning of hydrocarbons, which 
typically result in area-wide PAH and metals deposition to shallow soil. The Site also 
received fill that was excavated from a stormwater construction project and 
stockpiled on the southern portion of the Site; it is possible that the fill was impacted 
by industrial-and/or petroleum-related pollutants. 
 
Opinion:  It is the Environmental Professional’s opinion that there is high 
likelihood that shallow soil at the Site may be adversely impacted.  Should 
additional information regarding the disposition of surface soil related to 
surrounding industrial activities be desired, representative near surface soil 
samples could be collected from the Site and analyzed for PAHs, metals, and 
screened for VOCs to ascertain if the former industrial activities and the 
placement of fill in southern portion of the Site may have adversely impacted 
shallow soil quality at the Site.   
 
2. PCB impacts to shallow soil: Three utility poles with pole-mounted transformers 
were observed at the Site. In addition, past flooding from East Creek may have 
deposited PCB-impacted soils from the neighboring manufactured gas plant on the 
Site.  
 
Opinion:  It is the Environmental Professional’s opinion that there is a moderate 
chance of PCB contamination in shallow soil at the Site. Should additional 
information regarding the disposition of surface soil related to PCBs be desired 
shallow soil samples could be collected in the vicinity of the utility poles with 
pole-mounted transformers and intermittently on the Site to assess if the 
transformers leaked PCB containing fluids or if PCB impacted material from 
neighboring properties may have been introduced to the Site during previous 
flooding.   
 
3. Possible PCB-containing electrical equipment and building materials: Considering the 
age of the building, it is possible that electrical equipment such as fluorescent tube 
lights utilized PCB containing oils.  Staining, which appeared to be oily in nature, 
was observed in the building; it is possible that inks used by Sharp Offset Printing 
contained PCBs. In addition, PCB-containing building materials (such as roof sealant, 
mastic, paint, caulk, window glaze, etc.) may be present at the Site. Furthermore the 
majority of electrical equipment appeared to be removed from the building prior to 
the Site visit, so it is possible that transformers, capacitors, or other older electrical 
equipment  and/or machinery that may have used PCB containing fluid were once 
utilized at the facility and were since removed. 
 
Opinion:  It is the Environmental Professional’s opinion that there is a moderate 
chance of PCB contamination in the building. Should additional information 
regarding the possible presence of PCBs in the building be desired, a PCBbuilding
materials inspection could be conducted by a qualified environmental 
contractor and the findings summarized in a report.  Any suspect electrical 
equipment could be inspected and if appropriate, sampled for PCBs. This 
inspection could include an evaluation of the light ballasts and older electric 
equipment for possible PCBs as well as the collection of bulk samples of floor 
material (wood) for PCB analysis. 
 
4. Underground storage tanks:  The 1962 and 1971 Sanborn Maps (the two most recent 
maps) include the label “Fuel Oil Tks Under Conc. Fl” on an enclosure near the 
southeast corner of the demolished building. There is no record of the presence of 
these tanks with the exception of the Sanborn maps.  Additionally, a three-port fill 
and vent pipe, emitting an obvious petroleum odor, were observed on the eastern 
exterior wall of the building; these pipes are possibly connected to the 8,500 gallon 
fuel oil tank registered to the Site. The current property owner was not aware of any 
tanks on the property.  Finally, a 1995 JCO report associated with the neighboring 
Former Korner Pocket Site, indicated that elevated PID readings were reported in the 
northeast corner of the basement of the subject Site.  This report suggested that a 
7,500 gallon #2 fuel oil UST is present in this immediate area outside the northeast 
wall of the subject Site. 
 
Opinion:  It is the Environmental Professional’s opinion that there is a high 
likelihood that as many as three abandoned USTs exist at the Site. Should 
additional information regarding the presence of these USTs be desired, either 
exploratory test pitting and/or ground penetrating radar services could be used to 
evaluate the presence of these USTs. The State Vermont requires abandoned USTs 
be appropriately decommissioned.  If evidence of a release is confirmed during tank 
removal and additional information is desired regarding soil and groundwater 
quality in the vicinity of these USTs, soil and groundwater  samples could be 
collected and analyzed for VOCs, SVOCs, and possible lead (depending on the 
presumed age and residual contents of the tanks, i.e. old leaded gasoline). 
 
5. Floor pits: Four floor pits and what appeared to be a sewer clean out containing 
sediment were observed in the basement of the Site building.  
Opinion: It is the Environmental Professional’s opinion that there is a moderate 
chance that the sediment in these floor pits is contaminated. Should additional 
information regarding the presence of contamination in this sediment be desired, 
the contents of these pits and clean out could be screened for VOCs with a PID.  
Sediment present in the voids could also be sampled and analyzed of VOCs, PCBs, 
metals and PAHs to analytically confirm potential contaminant constitutes.  
 
6. Railroad Corridor: The Site is abutted by The Vermont Railway to the south. Considering the 
proximity to the tracks, it is likely that via atmospheric deposition, partially burnt 
hydrocarbons in the form of PAHs may be present in shallow soils on the Site.  Railroads 
also utilize herbicides to control vegetation along the rails and have historically used ACM 
in rail car brake systems.  
 
Opinion:  It is the Environmental Professional’s opinion that there is a moderate 
chance that the adjacent rail corridor has adversely impacted soil quality at the 
Site. Should additional information regarding the soil quality in the vicinity of the 
rail corridor be desired near surface soil samples could be collected in the southern 
portion of the Site and analyzed for PAHs, PCBs, metals, ACM and herbicides.   
 
7. Groundwater Related Neighboring Property:   The abutting hazardous waste site Former 
Korner Pocket [SMS#: 94-1727] has had reported groundwater impacts above the VGES.  
Although the Korner Pocket site was closed by VTDEC in 2012, a 1995 report for the site 
suggests the possible presence of VOC impacts and a UST outside the northeast corner of 
the building at the subject Site.   
  
Opinion:  It is the Environmental Professional’s opinion that there is a moderate 
chance that impacted groundwater from the Former Korner Pocket may have 
migrated and adversely impacted groundwater quality at the Site. Should additional 
information regarding groundwater quality be desired groundwater monitoring 
wells could be installed, samples collected, and analyzed for VOCs, SVOCs, and 
possibly PCBs.   
 
 
RECs beyond the Scope of ASTM 1527-13 and AAI 
   
1. Given the age of the building, LBP may coat surfaces of interior and exterior walls of 
the Site.  
  
Opinion: In order to confirm or deny the presence of LBP on Site, an inspection 
should be conducted by a certified lead paint inspector and a report generated 
outlining the findings. 

2. ACM was identified in the debris of the demolished Site building. Given the age and 
construction of the existing Site building, ACM may be present in that building as 
well.  
 
Opinion: An ACM inspection should be conducted by a certified ACM inspector 
and a report should be generated outlining the findings. This report should include 
a rough cost estimate for abatement of any ACM identified.  
 
Potential Offsite Issues for Consideration 
Neighboring Properties:  Eighteen hazardous waste sites (six active and twelve inactive) 
are located within a 0.25-mile radius of the Site.  The abutting site to the west (CVPSRutland
City Gas Works [SMS #: 77-0137]), identified groundwater impacts above the 
VGES and continues to be monitored due to elevated concentrations of PAHs, VOCs, 
and PCBs in groundwater.  Also, according to the 1962 and 1971 Sanborn maps, a former 
dry cleaner was located at 133 State Street, the current Foley Services Inc. [SMS #: 941627]
property.  Although a petroleum assessment has been performed and subsurface 
petroleum impacts have been reported, no assessment has been conducted to evaluate the 
presence of chlorinated VOCs in the sub-surface.  Additionally, a former filling station 
and currently a laundry mat occupy the property located 147 State Street.   Although not 
a State listed hazardous site, JCO understands that no environmental assessment of this 
property has occurred.  
 
Opinion:  It is the Environmental Professional’s opinion that there is a possibility 
that impacted groundwater and/or vapor from neighboring properties may have 
migrated onto the Site. Should additional information regarding groundwater or 
vapor quality be desired groundwater monitoring wells and soil gas monitoring 
points could be installed, samples collected, and analyzed for VOCs, and possibly 
SVOCs, and PCBs.   
 
 
1.0 INTRODUCTION 
The Johnson Company was retained by the Rutland Regional Planning 
Commission (RRPC) to conduct a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment (ESA) of the 
former Lynda Lee property located at 10 Cleveland Avenue in Rutland, Vermont (SMS # 
2016-4670; the Site).  The Site totals approximately 1.7 acres and hosts one abandoned 
building totaling approximately 89,115 square feet and the debris and foundation of a 
demolished building.  The facility has been vacant for approximately two decades. The 
Site had been used as an offset printing facility, garment factory, a lumber yard, and was 
reportedly utilized for industrial purposes associated with the rail line that forms the 
southern boundary of the Site.  The location of the Site is depicted in Figure 1.  
 
The purpose of the ESA was to identify recognized environmental conditions 
(RECs) associated with the Site that indicate the presence or likely presence of hazardous 
substances or petroleum products under conditions that suggest an existing release or a 
material threat of a release associated with the Site.  In addition, the presence of historic 
recognized environmental conditions (HRECs) – a past release of hazardous substance(s) 
that has been addressed to residential use standards or unrestricted use criteria – and 
controlled recognized environmental conditions (CREC) – a past release of hazardous 
substance(s) that has been addressed to non-residential use standards and is subject to 
some type of control – were identified for the Site if applicable. Furthermore, as defined 
in ASTM E 1527-13, a HREC is no longer a REC when the remaining environmental 
conditions are compliant with the most current regulatory criteria and a CREC is a REC. 
This ESA included reviewing existing information made available and/or that was 
reasonably ascertainable regarding current and past usage of the Site, determining the 
Site’s regulatory status, contacting appropriate personnel regarding current and past uses 
of the Site, investigating the potential for past releases of petroleum products and/or 
hazardous substances on the Site, and conducting an onsite reconnaissance to visually 
inspect the accessible portions of the Site.   

JCO understands that this Phase I ESA was completed for the Site in anticipation 
of a potential redevelopment of the Site by The Housing Trust of Rutland County. 
 
This ESA was performed by personnel from JCO who meet the definition of 
Environmental Professional as defined in 40 CFR Part 312, in conformance within the 
scope and limitations of  ASTM E 1527-13 and in compliance with 40 CFR Part 312, 
Standards and Practices for All Appropriate Inquiries.  Credentials of JCO personnel 
involved with the preparation of this ESA are included as Appendix 1. 
 
2.0 PROPERTY DESCRIPTION 
2.1 SETTING AND SURROUNDING DEVELOPMENT 
The Site is currently owned by John Ruggiero through Second City LLC and sits 
on an approximately 1.7-acre parcel located on the east side of Cleveland Avenue and the 
south side of State Street. Figure 1 displays the Site and host vicinity and Figure 2 
displays Site features of interest. The Site is bound by State Street to the north, residents 
and an abandoned filling station/automobile garage to the east, an active railroad corridor 
to the south, and Cleveland Avenue to the west.  The Site is situated in the central 
business district and is currently zoned commercial.  The Site topography is relatively flat 
with an embankment on the southern property boundary up to the rail corridor. The 
closest surface water feature is East Creek, which is located approximately 290 feet to the 
west of the Site. The rail corridor that forms the southern boundary of the property is 
operated by The Vermont Railway.  
 
The Site is located in downtown Rutland within a mixed-use, developed area of 
primarily commercial and industrial land, with residential buildings dispersed throughout 
the area. The original building on Site was constructed between 1890 and 1895 according 
to the Sanborn Maps (see Section 3.2.4), and the existing building was added onto that 
structure between 1942 and 1948 according to aerial photos (see Section 3.2.3)  in a 
Streamline Moderne architectural style, utilizing smooth orange/red ceramic tiles and 
thick opaque glass block rounded corners. In 2010 the back portion of the building was 
demolished (debris is still present) but the newer 1940s portion of the structure remains. 
There is currently no active use of the Site. 
 
2.2 HEATING, WATER AND SEWER 
As of February 3, 2016, the property is reportedly serviced by municipal water 
and sewer.  According to the Sanborn maps, the former (demolished) building on the 
property was heated using coal since 1895. The addition of fuel oil tanks, identified in the 
1962 map, off of the southeast corner of the former building, suggest the property 
switched to fuel oil around that time. In addition, according to the 1910 and 1916 
Sanborn maps, a former laundry department in the building used coal gas for heat. The 
existing building was historically heated with fuel oil, although the location of the oil 
tank is not indicated on the Sanborn map.  What appeared to be a boiler room was located 
along the north wall of the building which may have formerly contained an aboveground 
storage tank (AST). However, an 8,500-gallon underground storage tank (UST) is 
registered to the property; please see Section 4.3.3 for more details. That tank is likely 
located in a concrete vault, near a former loading dock in the southeast corner of the 
basement adjacent to a 3-pipe fill port and a vent pipe with a fuel oil odor that was 
observed on the exterior east wall of the building. 
 
2.3 GEOLOGY AND HYDROGEOLOGY 
The surficial geology at the Site is mapped as Deerfield loamy sand (NRCS, 
2010). The bedrock in the area is mapped as the Dunham Dolostone formation, which is a 
Cambrian age resistant carbonate rock (VT DEC1, 2016).  
Depth to groundwater and the direction of groundwater flow was not measured as 
part of this Phase I ESA. It is possible that groundwater flows west or southwest across 
the Site toward East Creek. 
 
2.4 THREATENED SPECIES AND WETLANDS 
According to the Vermont Agency of Natural Resources (ANR) Natural 
Resources Atlas, there is one rare, threatened, or endangered species that may reside 
within 0.5 miles of the nearest Site boundary. The species is listed as an invertebrate 
animal (EO_ID: 6106) with ranks of S2 (state rank) and G5 (global rank). The last 
observation was in 1978 and the animal appears to be associated with the Otter Creek 
southwest of the Site. There are no significant natural communities or wetlands mapped 
within a 0.5-mile radius of the nearest Site boundary. This information was accessed on 
December 8, 2016 (VT DEC1, 2016).  
3.0 PROPERTY HISTORY AND REVIEW OF EXISTING INFORMATION 
3.1 PRIOR INVESTIGATIONS 
JCO understands that no formal environmental investigations have been 
conducted at the Site. According to a news article a fire occurred at the abandoned 
structure in October 2015. The fire was apparently caused by squatters burning material 
inside the building to keep warm. The article also mentions that a State Health Inspector 
tested building debris at the property in December 2014 and the debris was found to 
contain asbestos (Times Argus, 2015).  
 
 In April 2016, Clay Point Associates, Inc (CPAI) performed a limited asbestos 
containing material (ACM) inspection of the building debris remaining from the 
demolished south end of the commercial structure on the Site. Only the accessible 
(surface) material of the debris piles was evaluated. A total of 58 bulk samples of suspect 
ACM were sampled on April 19, 2016, and 52 of these samples were analyzed using 
polarized light microscopy (PLM) analysis. Building debris including hardboard, siding, 
caulking, felt paper, and cement board were found to contain asbestos (CPAI, 2016). 
 
 In October 2016, Harper Environmental Associates (HEA) collected samples of 
potential ACM and retained Asbestos Identification Laboratory (AIL) to analyze these 
samples for asbestos using PLM analysis. Specifically, four samples of concrete mortar 
were analyzed and asbestos was not detected in any sample (AIL, 2016).  According to 
the property owner these samples were collected from the debris pile of the demolished 
building. However, on March 15, 2017, JCO contacted Cliff Harper of HEA to request 
clarification regarding where these additional ACM samples of mortar were collected.  
Mr. Harper verified that these samples are representative of mortar from within the 
portion of the building that remains intact and were not collected from the debris pile  
 
3.2 HISTORICAL REVIEW 
The earliest confirmed use of the Site is depicted on the 1895 Sanborn map, 
which shows the Site with three structures: a dwelling, a small structure labeled “C.C.”, 
and a large building labeled Tim & Co. Shirt Factory.  The property has a long history of 
textile manufacturing, and also has been used as a lumber yard, offset printing facility, 
and was reportedly utilized for industrial purposes associated with the rail line that forms 
the southern boundary of the Site. 
 
3.2.1 Land Records 
A search of the Land Records at the Rutland City Clerk’s office was conducted on 
February 3, 2017 but may be incomplete.  Table 1 provides a summary of the ownership 
history for the Site. The property includes multiple parcels; ownership history for the 
parcels was difficult to track and the ownership history summarized in the following table 
(next page) may include land transfers not including the subject parcels. 
 
3.2.2 U.S.G.S. Topographic Maps 
United States Geological Survey (USGS) topographic maps from 2012, 
1997/1996, 1988, 1980, 1964/1961, 1895/1893 and 1891 were obtained from 
Environmental Data Resources (EDR) and reviewed as part of this ESA.  All of USGS 
topographic maps do not display any structures on the Site; the railroad that forms the 
southern boundary of the Site is shown on all maps. Copies of these maps are provided as 
Appendix 2. 
3.2.3 Aerial Photographs 
Digital ortho-photographs from 2012, 2011, 2009, 2006, 1884, 1992, 1986, 1976, 
1965, 1963, 1957 and 1942 were obtained from EDR and were reviewed as part of this 
ESA.  The resolution in the photographs from 1992 and 1976 are too poor to discern Site 
features. The Site appears in its pre-demolition configuration (with two connected 
buildings) in all photographs, with the exception of the photograph from 1942 in which 
only the southern (now demolished) building is present. What appears to be residences 
are located on the northern portion of the Site in the 1942 photograph where the existing 
building is now located. Copies of these photos are provided as Appendix 3. 
 
3.2.4 Sanborn Fire Insurance Maps 
The Sanborn Fire Insurance Maps (1879, 1885, 1890, 1895, 1900, 1905, 1910, 
1916, 1925, 1948, 1962 and 1971) were obtained from EDR and reviewed.  Copies of

3.2.6 Environmental Questionnaire 
JCO’s standard environmental questionnaire was completed by John Ruggiero, 
property owner, on February 22, 2017. A copy of the questionnaire has been included as 
Appendix 6. 
 
3.3 INTERVIEWS 
3.3.1 Current Owner/Occupant 
The current owner of the Site is John Ruggiero.  Mr. Ruggiero was interviewed by 
Kurt Muller and Stephanie Hunt of JCO on February 3, 2017 regarding the Site. Mr. 
Ruggiero explained that the Site is uninhabited and that the Site building is currently 
vacant. Mr. Ruggiero indicated that the building had been uninhabited since Sharp Offset 
Printing vacated the premises. He also discussed the asbestos testing that has been 
completed at the property to date, and indicated that he plans to have all construction 
debris from the demolished building removed from the property in accordance with 
Vermont Department of Health guidelines and permits by May 30, 2017.  
 
Mr. Ruggiero also discussed fill from a stormwater construction project that was 
temporarily stored on the southern portion of the property. Some remaining debris/soil 
was still located on the property on the foundation of the former building; Mr. Ruggiero 
indicated that the construction company, Kingsbury Construction, would be removing it. 
He also stated that the company ensured that the fill was tested and was clean. No records 
were provided to corroborate that the fill was clean. According to Elisabeth Kulas, 
Executive Director of Housing Trust of Rutland County, the debris/soil was from the 
Northwest Neighborhood Sewer Separation Project that occurred on Library Avenue, 
located two blocks north of the Site, in 2015.   
 
Mr. Ruggiero indicated that the first use of the property, as discovered through 
personal research conducted at the Rutland Historical Society, was as three residences in 
the mid-1800s. According to Mr. Ruggiero, the residences were demolished in place, 
with debris contained within the foundation, and then built upon. Effort was made to 
corroborate Mr. Ruggiero’s research, but the Rutland Historical Society was closed for 
business during an attempted visit on February 3, 2017, and had very limited hours. In 
addition, Ed Bove (RRPC) had indicated on the EPA Site Eligibility Form (dated October 
21, 2016) that the Site was reportedly utilized for industrial purposes associated with the 
rail line that forms the southern boundary of the Site. 
 
3.3.2 Past Owner/Occupant 
Mr. Ruggiero provided the name of one of the previous owners of the building 
when it was a dress manufacturer, Nick Micalizzi. An attempt was made to contact Mr. 
Micalizzi on February 7, 2017 and a message was left for him. No response was received.  
 
3.3.3 State/Local Officials 
The Town Health Officer Michael Brookman was interviewed by e-mail on 
December 8, 2016.  Please see Sections 4.4.1 for information on the interview.  
Wendy Anderson with the Waste Management Division (WMD) of the VT DEC 
was contacted on February 14, 2017 via e-mail by Stephanie Hunt (JCO). Documents 
relating to site investigation activities at nearby properties of interest were made available 
in electronic format and provided to JCO by Ms. Anderson. These documents were 
reviewed and references as appropriate in the following sections. 
 
3.3.4 Neighboring or Nearby Property Owner/Occupant 
According to the property owner Mr. Ruggiero, he is also the owner of the 
neighboring Former Korner Pocket (SMS #94-1727) located at 148 State Street. The 
property is currently vacant; Mr. Ruggiero was not familiar with the past environmental 
investigations conducted at that property, which are discussed Section 4.3.2.  
 
4.0 REGULATORY STATUS 
 A search of available environmental records was conducted by EDR. The EDR

4.3.1 Vermont Sites Management Section Hazardous Sites List 
 The Site is listed by the VT DEC Sites Management Section (SMS) as an active 
hazardous waste site (SMS #: 2016-4670); please see Section 3.1 for more details. While 
the Site is listed as an active hazardous waste site, the site status is designated as “release 
not identified” and a tracking number was only assigned to the Site because it is being 
managed by the VT DEC. A radius search of the ANR Natural Resource Atlas returned 
102 additional hazardous waste sites within 1.0-mile of the nearest Site boundary. Of 
these, 48 are within 0.5 miles of the nearest Site boundary and 26 of the 48 are closed 
with SMAC or No Further Action Planned (NFAP) designation.  The SMAC or NFAP 
status indicates that environmental assessment and/or management has been performed 
on a site to the extent that the VT DEC does not see a need for additional management 
activity at the time the designation letter was issued.  However, an inactive site may be 
reopened should additional information become available or applicable regulatory 
standards change. A total of 18 (12 inactive and 6 active) sites are located within 0.25mile
of the Site (VT DEC1, 2016).  Table 2 and Table 3, below, summarize the active 
and inactive hazardous wastes sites located within 0.5-mile of the nearest Site boundary, 
respectively. The information provided in these tables was extracted from the ANR 
Natural Research Atlas on December 9, 2016.

4.3.2 Nearby Properties of Interest 
The following six properties were identified as being of potential environmental 
concern based on past uses, proximity to the Site, likelihood of impacting groundwater at 
the Site, and a history of site investigations. Figure 3 displays the nearby properties of 
interest.   
 
CVPS-Rutland City Gas Works (SMS #: 77-0137) 
This site is located at 0 Cleveland Avenue and abuts the Site to the west. 
The property was a former coal gasification plant starting in 1901 and was 
purchased by Central Vermont Public Services (CVPS) in 1929. The property was 
converted to a propane distribution facility in 1948 until 1954. Transformer repair 
and operations were conducted at the property in the 1970s and 1980s. A 150 kw 
solar array is currently on the property. Multiple environmental investigations 
have been conducted on the property since 1989. 
 
A Corrective Action Plan (CAP) was prepared by Haley and Aldrich, Inc. 
(Haley & Aldrich) in 2009. According to the CAP, contaminants in shallow soil 
on the site include polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) above the Federal Toxic 
Substance Control Act (TSCA) regulatory limit for high occupancy areas and 
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) above US EPA Region 9 Preliminary 
Remediation Goals (PRGs). The highest PCB and PAH concentrations were 
found in the shallow soil in the western portion of the site near a former electrical 
substation, with other intermittent locations where elevated PAH and PCB 
contamination found in the central portion of the site. PAH contamination was 
encountered as deep at 56 feet below ground surface; the contamination was 
described as an “oily residue”. Groundwater at the property was also impacted by 
PAHs, petroleum-related volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and PCBs above 
Vermont Groundwater Enforcement Standards (VGES), and varying amounts of  
light non-aqueous phase liquid (LNAPL) were observed in the central and 
southern portions of the property. Analysis of LNAPL indicated that it was related 
to historic aboveground storage of fuel oil. Groundwater at the property flows 
generally south-southwest across the site (towards East Creek) and is influenced 
by the Creek (Haley & Aldrich, 2009).  
 
 
 In 2010 CVPS performed self-implementing cleanup of PCB impacts to 
soil and concrete at the property, which is detailed in a 2011 report prepared by 
Haley & Aldrich. Manufactured gas product impacted material that was 
encountered during activities was also removed. A total of 4,864 tons of soil and 
concrete were removed and disposed of at a TSCA-approved landfill. Excavation 
was conducted until the remedial goal of total PCB concentrations of less than 1 
part per million (ppm) were attained for confirmatory samples (Haley & Aldrich, 
2011).   
 
 
 The most recent groundwater monitoring report available on the VTDEC 
website for this property from December 2015 (describing fall 2015 sampling) 
was also reviewed for this ESA. According to the report, concentrations of 
dissolved VOCs and PAHs have remained stable when compared to 2014 
sampling results; benzene, benzo(a)pyrene, and naphthalene remain above VGES. 
The consultant did not observe measurable LNAPL in any wells. Historical data 
included in the report showed that PCBs were first detected in groundwater in 
2004 (above VGES) and were last detected in 2012 (Horizons, 2015). According 
to the VTDEC website, biannual groundwater monitoring continues at the 
property. In addition, the VTDEC WM-ID database indicates that an institutional 
control is in place for this property, and that an engineering control in the form  a 
paved surface is covering the majority of the property. 

Former Korner Pocket (SMS#: 94-1727)  
This site is located at 148 State Street and abuts the Site to the east. The 
property was formerly a gasoline filling station until about 1968 and was an 
autobody shop until 1980. A First Letter was issued on December 12, 1994 after a 
Phase II ESA performed by JCO in 1994 revealed VOC and semi-volatile organic 
compound (SVOC) contamination in groundwater. Naphthalene, total xylenes, 
and ethylbenzene were detected at levels exceeding VGES. The report noted, that 
based on the westward groundwater flow direction, it is likely that the 
contamination affects the groundwater quality beneath Sharp Offset Printing 
property (the Site; VTDEC, 1994a).  
 
In March of 1995, JCO performed screening for VOC vapors in basements 
nearby the site using a photoionization detector (PID).  This screening for VOC 
vapors included an assessment of the vapor quality in the basement of the Site.  
Specifically, the 1995 JCO report states:  In the northeast corner of the basement 
of Sharp Offset Printing we obtained PID readings of up to 135 ppm from within 
two cracks in the concrete foundation wall. We were informed that a 7,500 gallon 
#2 fuel oil UST is present in this immediate area outside the wall. The age of the 
UST is not known, but it is known to be more than 21 years old. It is likely that the 
readings obtained at this location are a function of the presence of this UST, and 
are not from the Site, which is approximately 60 feet away. (JCO, 1995). 
 
This suggests that another UST may be present outside the building in the 
northeast portion of the Site.  

Groundwater sampling at the property performed by JCO in 2008 revealed 
that no VOC compounds were detected above VGES. Based on these results, JCO 
recommended that groundwater sampling at the property be discontinued and the 
site be considered for SMAC status (JCO, 2008). JCO abandoned the monitoring 
wells at the property in 2010 and the site received SMAC status in 2012 (VTDEC, 
2012). 
 
H-our Mart Inc. (SMS#: 95-1900)  
This property is located at 257-263 West Street and is located 
approximately 200 feet south of the Site. A First Letter was issued to the property 
owners in 1996 due to an off-site source of contamination discovered at the 
neighboring J.P. Noonan site which was likely migrating from the H-our Mart site 
(VTDEC, 1996). The site was historically a filling station, automobile garage, and 
bulk fuel storage facility. 
 
A CAP was prepared by Leggette, Brashears & Graham, Inc. (LBG) in 
2009. According to the CAP contaminants in shallow soil on the site include 
VOCs, PAHs, and metals (arsenic, iron and lead) above US EPA Region 9 PRGs 
and contaminants in groundwater include VOCs and metals (arsenic, beryllium, 
lead and zinc) above VGES. The selected corrective action for the site was to 
isolate site soil under 6-inches of clean topsoil and establishment of a vegetation 
cover. According to the CAP, groundwater data indicate contaminant trends to be 
stable to declining; therefore no corrective action with the exception of natural 
attenuation was proposed for the site. No additional reports were made available 
for this site on the VTDEC website, but the CAP did indicate that a Phase I ESA 
was prepared for the site in 2005 and a Phase II ESA was completed for the site in 
2006.  The CAP also suggested that the Phase II ESA consisted of removing a 
3,000-gallon and two 8,000-gallon gasoline USTs, monitoring well installation,  
and collection of soil and groundwater samples.  The CAP further explains that a 
follow-up Additional Site Investigation was completed in 2006 and 2007, which 
included additional monitoring well installation, the installation of soil gas 
monitor points, and soil and groundwater sampling. Another supplemental site 
investigation was conducted later in 2007 which included additional monitoring 
well installation, and sampling of groundwater and soil gas. Results indicated that 
the highest concentrations of contaminants were found in the area of the former 
USTs, and that most of the contaminant plume remains on site. Groundwater 
flows southwest toward East Creek (LBG, 2009).  
 
A certificate of completion for the property indicates that an institutional 
control is in place for this property and that a 6-inch layer of clean topsoil was 
placed over soil impacted by PAHs and hydroseeded. The certificate of 
completion also states that subsurface soils 5.5-8.5 feet in depth are impacted by 
residual petroleum contamination and that groundwater beneath the property 
remains impacted by petroleum contaminates in excess of VGES but that the 
plume is not a threat to down gradient properties or the environment (VTDEC3, 
2016).  
 
Foley Services Inc. (SMS #: 94-1627)  
This property is located at 133 State Street and is approximately 350 feet 
northeast of the Site. A First Letter issued to the property owners in 1994 
described the removal of a 2,000 gallon UST from the site in June 1994 during 
which petroleum contaminated soil with a peak PID reading of 1500 ppm was 
encountered. All contaminated soil was backfilled (VTDEC, 1994b). 
 
Griffin International (Griffin) submitted a Report on the Investigation of 
Subsurface Petroleum Contamination for the property in September 1994. Griffin  
analyzed groundwater at the site from three existing monitoring wells for VOCs; 
methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) and benzene were detected above VGES. 
Groundwater at the site was measured to flow northwest (Griffin, 1994.). An 
Annual Groundwater Monitoring Report prepared by Griffin from 2000 was also 
available on the VTDEC website and was reviewed. Griffin analyzed 
groundwater at the site from the three monitoring wells for VOCs; MTBE, 
benzene, and 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene were detected above VGES (Griffin, 2000). 
  
 Based on follow-up correspondence with Kimberly Caldwell of VTDEC a 
10,000-gallon #6 fuel oil UST was closed in place at the property in October 
2016, and that additional work has yet to be completed.  A 2016 UST closure 
report prepared by KAS documenting this work was reviewed; according to the 
report no soil samples could be collected during tank closure to confirm that there 
have been no releases from the UST (KAS, 2016).  
 
In addition to the petroleum related concerns for this property the 1941 
Mannings Directory and the 1962 and 1971 Sanborn Maps suggested that a dry 
cleaner was formally on this property as well as an auto lacquering service.  
According to Ms. Caldwell, no investigation has been conducted at that property 
to assess potential impacts of the former dry-cleaning operations. 
 
Suburban VT (Former Agway Bulk Plant; SMS#: 2003-3140) 
 This property is located at 295 West Street and is located approximately 
500 feet southwest of the Site. A SMAC letter issued to the property owners in 
March 2014 was available on the VTDEC website for the property and was 
reviewed for this ESA. According to the SMAC letter, contamination was found 
at the property during a Phase I ESA conducted in September 2003. Subsequent 
investigations identified stained soils and concrete, and petroleum related  
groundwater contamination. An additional site investigation in 2006 identified 
chlorinated solvents in groundwater at the property above VGES, including 
tetrachloroethene (PCE), trichloroethene (TCE). The General Electric factory 
located at 210 Columbian Avenue (see below) was identified as the possible 
source of the chlorinated solvent contamination. In 2007, it was determined that 
petroleum related groundwater contamination at the property was stable or 
declining and that no further groundwater monitoring was necessary. The wells at 
the property were abandoned in August 2012, the onsite building was demolished 
in November 2013, and a notice to the deed was recorded in June 2012. 
Contaminated soils were left on site under a minimum of 2 feet of clean fill 
(VTDEC, 2014).  No other reports for this property were available on the VTDEC 
website.  Considering this property is assumed to be hydraulically down gradient 
and on the opposite side of the East Creek, it is unlikely that the associated 
contamination would significantly contribute adversely to the environmental 
quality at the Site. 
 
210 Columbian Ave (SMS #: 2014-4470/former 87-0081) 
This property is located at 210 Columbian Avenue and is located 
approximately 400 feet west/southwest of the Site. This property was formerly 
owned by the Columbian Marble Manufacturing Company, which operated a 
marble cutting and finishing facility on the property.  The Columbian facility is 
shown in the 1905 and 1916 Sanborn map.  In 1925, the facility is shown as the 
United Marble Companies, Inc.  According to the 1948 map, the 210 Columbian 
Avenue property was owned by Tampax Inc.: the city directories list Tampax Inc. 
at 210 Columbian Avenue from 1949 to 1955.   The property is currently listed as 
General Electric Aviation Plant #1. A Groundwater Monitoring Report prepared 
by Tetra Tech in January 2015 for General Electric was available on the VTDEC 
website for the property and was reviewed for this ESA. 18 wells are sampled 
semi-annually at the site. Constituents of concern that were detected above VGES 
at the site include PCE, TCE, and cis-1,2-dichloroethene (cDCE). Groundwater 
flows south-southeast toward East Creek (Tetra Tech, 2015). No other reports for 
this property were available on the VTDEC website; however, the VTDEC WMID
indicates that an institutional control is in place for this property.  Considering 
this property is assumed to be hydraulically down gradient and on the opposite 
side of the East Creek, it is unlikely that the associated contamination would 
significantly contribute adversely to the environmental quality at the Site.  
 
  147 State Street (No SMS #) 
The EDR Radius Map Report identified the property at 147 State Street as 
a Historic Cleaner. Based upon review of the Sanborn maps, the EDR report, and 
internet research, it appears this property has been a Laundromat (Washbucklers) 
since 1987 and has no history as a dry cleaner.  Although, records suggest that dry 
cleaning operations did not occur on this property, this does not eliminate the 
potential for solvents having been used in the laundering process.  The Sanborn 
maps also suggest that this property was a former filling station between at least 
1962 and 1971.  JCO understands that no environmental assessment has been 
performed on this parcel.   
 
4.3.3 Underground Storage Tank List 
The Site is listed with the VT DEC as an UST facility (VT DEC1, 2016; VT 
DEC2, 2016).  The Site is assigned facility ID 7739194 and the facility name is Sharp 
Building. An 8,500-gallon capacity fuel oil UST was installed at the Site in 1974 
according to the record. The tank status is listed as Active.   

4.3.4 Spills List 
According to the WM-ID, no spills have occurred at the Site. However, one spill 
occurred on Cleveland Avenue roadside in 2011. In that incident, 300 gallons of #2 fuel 
oil was spilled by a fuel delivery truck (Report # WMD888). 
 
Additionally, one spill occurred at the CVPS Rutland Gas Works property, which 
is across Cleveland Avenue from the Site, in 2010. In that incident, a boom being used to 
implement remedial action at the property washed downstream and sheens could be seen 
on East Creek (Report #WMD484). 
 
4.3.5 Landfills 
There are no certified landfills within a 0.5-mile search radius of the nearest Site 
boundary (EPA7, 1995; VT DEC1, 2016; VT DEC2, 2016; EPA8, 2016).  
 
4.3.6 Institutional Controls/Engineering Controls Registries 
An investigation of the records available at the Rutland City Clerk’s office 
revealed that no institutional and/or engineering controls had been filed in the Land 
Records for the Site as of February 3, 2017.  
 
4.3.7 Voluntary Cleanup Sites 
Vermont does not specifically have a voluntary cleanup program, but the 
Brownfield Reuse Environmental Liability Limitation Act (BRELLA, effective July 1, 
2008), acts as one for non-responsible parties.   
 
4.3.8 Brownfield Sites 
The Site is not listed on the WM-ID as a Brownfield site (VT DEC1, 2016; VT 
DEC2, 2016; EPA8, 2016).  There are four Brownfield sites located within a 0.5-mile 
radius of the nearest property boundary. Please see Tables 2 and 3 in Section 4.3.1 for 
site details, the site numbers are the following: 95-1900, 2012-4305, 2008-3813, and 
2013-4386 (VT DEC1, 2016; VT DEC2, 2016; EPA8, 2016).   
 
4.4 LOCAL REGULATORY FILES 
4.4.1 Health Department 
Current city Health Officer Michael Brookman was reached for an interview on 
December 8, 2016. Mr. Brookman has been the Health Officer since January 2014. Mr. 
Brookman was aware of the fire that occurred in 2015 and indicated that a hole was burnt 
through some of the flooring. Mr. Brookman also indicated that the State Department of 
Health performed asbestos testing on demolition debris.  Mr. Brookman was not aware of 
any additional incidents, fires, spills, or environmental concerns at the Site (Brookman, 
2016).  
 
4.4.2 Local Electric Utility Company 
The Site building does not currently have electric service, but historically was 
serviced by Green Mountain Power. The former CVPS substation abuts the Site to the 
west. Multiple electric utility poles appeared to be within the property boundaries, with 
three utility poles that had pole-mounted transformers. JCO spoke with Green Mountain 
Power on March 20, 2017 to determine whether the utility poles on the property were 
owned by Green Mountain Power, if the transformers are PCB free, and when the utility 
poles were last replaced. The representative from Green Mountain Power indicated that 
some of the poles on the property are owned by Green Mountain Power and some are 
owned by Fairpoint Communications, but that all pole-mounted transformers are owned 
by Green Mountain Power. According to the Green Mountain Power representative, there 
is no record available regarding when the transformers were installed or of past 
transformers on the property. The representative stated that one of the utility poles was 
installed in 1953, and all other poles on the property were installed after 1989 but that 
there is no guarantee that the pole-mounted transformers are the same age or newer than 
the date of pole installation as older transformers are regularly re-used.  The 
representative indicated that in order to determine the age of the transformers on the 
property a line crew would need to inspect the transformers for an installation date.  
 
4.5 POLYCHLORINATED BIPHENYLS 
A materials inspection for PCB containing building materials was not performed as part 
of this ESA, but given the age of building, it is possible that caulks, roofing materials, sealants, 
paint, window glaze, tile mastic or other building materials that contain PCBs are present in the 
building. In addition, three utility poles with pole-mounted transformers were observed within or 
just outside to the property boundary. These transformers may have used PCB containing 
dielectric fluid. In addition, old tube fluorescent lights, which may have used PCB-containing 
ballasts, were present in the Site building. Furthermore, past flooding of East Creek may have 
carried PCB-contaminated soils from the neighboring CVPS-Rutland City Gas Works property 
onto the Site. Finally, PCBs have historically been a component of inks and paints and 
considering the former use of the Site as a printing business it is possible that PCB containing 
inks may have been used on Site and potentially released on to the floor.  Therefore, PCB 
impacts to the building and/or surrounding property may have occurred.   
 
4.6 NON-AAI/ASTM SCOPE CONSIDERATIONS 
4.6.1 Asbestos and Lead Paint Issues 
A lead based paint (LBP) assessment was not performed as part of this ESA, but 
chipped and peeling painted surfaces were observed throughout the interior of the 
building.  Given the age of the building, it is likely some of the paint may contain lead. 
An ACM assessment was not performed as part of this Phase I ESA; however, asbestos 
analysis of building materials from the demolished building on Site has been conducted. 
Please see Section 3.1 or the referenced reports for details; the testing indicated that 
building debris including hardboard, siding, caulking, felt paper, and cement board 
contain asbestos. Sampling and analysis of potential ACM has not been conducted on the 
existing building, but given the age of the building, it is possible that some building 
materials contain asbestos. In addition, the proximity of the Site to the active railroad 
causes an additional asbestos risk given that rail car brake systems formerly used asbestos 
containing material. The presence of asbestos containing materials should be assessed by 
a certified asbestos contractor. 
 
4.7 HISTORIC RECOGNIZED ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITION (HREC) 
 A HREC is defined by ASTM in the E1527-13 standard as “a past release of 
hazardous substance(s) that has been addressed to the satisfaction of the current and 
applicable regulatory authority or meeting unrestricted use criteria established by a 
regulatory authority, without subjecting the property to any required controls (for 
example, property use restrictions, activity and use limitations, institutional controls, or 
engineering controls).” HRECs are not considered RECs. No HRECs were identified for 
the Site. 
 
5.0 PROPERTY RECONNAISSANCE 
A Site reconnaissance was conducted on February 3, 2017 by Kurt Muller and 
Stephanie Hunt of JCO. Mr. Muller and Ms. Hunt were accompanied by Elisabeth Kulas 
(Housing Trust of Rutland County), Kimberly Caldwell (VT DEC) and John Ruggiero 
(property owner).  The Site reconnaissance included an inspection of accessible interior 
and exterior portions of the Site.  The Site reconnaissance was a non-intrusive (i.e. no 
sampling or screening performed) investigation that focused on identifying indications of 
any existing or potential risks to human health or the environment. 
   
The weather conditions during the visit were partly sunny with a temperature of 
approximately 27 degrees Fahrenheit and several inches of snow cover. Site conditions 
on the day of the reconnaissance are documented in the photographs included as 
Appendix 8 of this report. 
5.1   EXTERIOR OBSERVATIONS 
The exterior layout of the Site (parking lots, green space, building locations, etc.) 
is shown on Figure 2.  The existing site building occupies the northern half of the 
property; the demolished building is off the south wall of the existing building and all 
construction debris remains on Site within the foundation of the demolished building. 
The southern wall of the existing building was also demolished and multiple windows are 
broken, exposing this building to the elements. The area north of the existing building is 
an asphalt parking lot, the areas east of the existing building and south of the demolished 
building appear to be green space (unconfirmed due to snow cover), and the area west of 
the existing and former buildings is green space with a concrete walkway.  A metal 
security fence defines the eastern property boundary.  
 
Multiple debris piles were observed on the green spaces east and south of the Site 
building. The piles appeared to contain stumps, tree cuttings, scrap metal, general trash 
(plastic bottles, plastic bags, etc.), tires, and old lumber (reportedly from the demolished 
building); many of the piles or portions of the piles were obscured by snow.  In addition, 
two unlabeled drums were observed on the adjoining property leaning against the security 
fence that marks the Site’s eastern boundary. The fill that is discussed in Section 3.3.1 
was observed on the southernmost part of the foundation of the former building. A 
minimum of nine utility poles were observed to be either within or just outside of the 
property boundary; pole-mounted transformers were observed on three of the utility 
poles, one of which appeared to have leaked in the past.  
 
What appeared to be a fill and vent pipe were observed on the north exterior wall 
of the Site building; these were likely formerly connected to a since removed above 
ground storage tank (AST) within the building.  It should be noted that the former boiler 
room was identified on the opposite side of the northern exterior wall.  In addition, a 
three-port fill pipe and vent pipe were observed on the eastern side of the Site building, 
towards the south end of the building. The tank these pipes are connected to appeared to 
be within a concrete vault in the basement of the building. Odor from within the vent pipe 
indicated that there is residual fuel present. These pipes may be connected to the 8,500gallon
fuel oil tank registered to the property. Three pipes were also observed on the west 
exterior wall of the Site building; these pipes are assumed to be related to the sprinkler 
system in the building as the sprinkler distribution system is in the same location on the 
interior of the building. 
 
5.2   INTERIOR OBSERVATIONS 
The property consists of a large, unoccupied commercial building with two stories 
and a basement. The north section of the building is of metal frame construction with tile 
faced masonry walls and wood floor and roof support systems.  The demolished building 
was a wood frame structure that had two stories and a basement. The existing building is 
approximately 180 feet by 95 feet; the demolished building was approximately 180 feet 
by 60 feet. The building was formerly lit with tube fluorescent lights, which may have 
used PCB-containing ballasts. In addition, the majority of electrical equipment was 
removed from the building, so it is possible that transformers or other electrical devices 
or machinery that may have contained PCBs were once utilized at the facility. 
 
 The Site building was accessed through a door on the northwest corner of the 
building, which leads to a two-story staircase that accesses the first and second floors of 
the building. This staircase had peeling paint, which given the age of the building, may 
contain lead. A second stairwell also located near the northwest corner of the building 
leads from the first floor to the basement. A loading dock with an overhead door is 
located along the southern wall near the southeast corner of the building, and an elevator 
shaft is located just north of the loading dock. Various debris was located in the elevator 
shaft, including old doors, guano and bird feathers, and insulation. 

The first and second floors are completely empty, with the exception of some 
empty paint cans, fallen insulation, some lumber, and the occasional piece of furniture or 
television. What appeared to be staining was noted on the wood floors on the second 
floor; the staining may also be from ponding water from water entering the building 
through the windows or roof. One of the stained areas appeared to contain a hard waxlike
material.   
 
In the basement, what appear to be two former utility rooms are were identified 
on either side of the stairwell.   The first on the west side of the staircase (along the 
northern exterior wall) was likely the former boiler room and may have formerly 
contained an AST based on pipes entering that room.  The second room was located on 
the east side of the staircase where a chimney and an electrical panel are located.  
Standing water was present in this room, obstructing the floor. A pipe which was 
insulated with potential ACM was observed in this room as well. A bathroom and what 
appeared to be a storage closet are located in the far southwest corner of the basement. 
According to Mr. Ruggiero, the basement floor was formerly covered with sediment that 
entered the property during the flooding caused by Hurricane Irene in August 2011.  The 
sediment had since been removed.  Four “pits” were noted in the basement floor which 
appeared to be approximately 2 ft by 3 ft and of unknown depth. Two of the pits 
contained pipes and soil, while the other three appeared to be filled with sediment, 
although it is possible that pipes were also located in the pits and just covered with 
sediment.  In addition, what appeared to be a sewer line clean out was observed in the 
basement directly next to a plastic 55-gallon drum. The drum was labeled BARKEM404,
which is a water additive. A sprinkler distribution system was also observed in 
the basement.

7.0 RECOGNIZED ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS & CONCLUSIONS 
JCO has performed a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment in conformance 
with the scope and limitations of ASTM Practice E-1527-13 of the former Lynda Lee 
property located at 10 Cleveland Avenue, Rutland, Vermont (the Site).  Any exception 
to, or deletions from, this practice are described in Section 8.1 of this report.  This 
assessment has revealed no evidence of recognized environmental conditions (RECs) or 
controlled recognized environmental conditions (CRECs) in connection with the 
property except for the following:    

RECS: 
 
1. Deposition of industrial-related pollutants to shallow soil: The Site and the areas 
immediately surrounding the Site were historically used for a variety of industrial 
activities including a foundry, machine shop, manufactured gas facility, lumber yard, 
offset printing (which may have utilized PCB containing inks), textile manufacturing, 
and railcar traffic. In addition, the Site was formerly heated using a coal-fired furnace 
and fuel oil. Industrial activities often involve the burning of hydrocarbons, which 
typically result in area-wide PAH and metals deposition to shallow soil. The Site also 
received fill that was excavated from a stormwater construction project and 
stockpiled on the southern portion of the Site; it is possible that the fill was impacted 
by industrial-and/or petroleum-related pollutants. 
 
Opinion:  It is the Environmental Professional’s opinion that there is high 
likelihood that shallow soil at the Site may be adversely impacted.  Should 
additional information regarding the disposition of surface soil related to 
surrounding industrial activities be desired, representative near surface soil 
samples could be collected from the Site and analyzed for PAHs, metals, and 
screened for VOCs to ascertain if the former industrial activities and the 
placement of fill in southern portion of the Site may have adversely impacted 
shallow soil quality at the Site.   
 
2. PCB impacts to shallow soil: Three utility poles with pole-mounted transformers 
were observed at the Site. In addition, past flooding from East Creek may have 
deposited PCB-impacted soils from the neighboring manufactured gas plant on the 
Site.  
 
Opinion:  It is the Environmental Professional’s opinion that there is a moderate 
chance of PCB contamination in shallow soil at the Site. Should additional 
information regarding the disposition of surface soil related to PCBs be desired 
shallow soil samples could be collected in the vicinity of the utility poles with 
pole-mounted transformers and intermittently on the Site to assess if the 
transformers leaked PCB containing fluids or if PCB impacted material from 
neighboring properties may have been introduced to the Site during previous 
flooding.   
 
3. Possible PCB-containing electrical equipment and building materials: Considering the 
age of the building, it is possible that electrical equipment such as fluorescent tube 
lights utilized PCB containing oils.  Staining, which appeared to be oily in nature, 
was observed in the building; it is possible that inks used by Sharp Offset Printing 
contained PCBs. In addition, PCB-containing building materials (such as roof sealant, 
mastic, paint, caulk, window glaze, etc.) may be present at the Site. Furthermore the 
majority of electrical equipment appeared to be removed from the building prior to 
the Site visit, so it is possible that transformers, capacitors, or other older electrical 
equipment  and/or machinery that may have used PCB containing fluid were once 
utilized at the facility and were since removed. 
 
Opinion:  It is the Environmental Professional’s opinion that there is a moderate 
chance of PCB contamination in the building. Should additional information 
regarding the possible presence of PCBs in the building be desired, a PCBbuilding
materials inspection could be conducted by a qualified environmental 
contractor and the findings summarized in a report.  Any suspect electrical 
equipment could be inspected and if appropriate, sampled for PCBs. This 
inspection could include an evaluation of the light ballasts and older electric 
equipment for possible PCBs as well as the collection of bulk samples of floor 
material (wood) for PCB analysis. 
 
4. Underground storage tanks:  The 1962 and 1971 Sanborn Maps (the two most recent 
maps) include the label “Fuel Oil Tks Under Conc. Fl” on an enclosure near the 
southeast corner of the demolished building. There is no record of the presence of 
these tanks with the exception of the Sanborn maps.  Additionally, a three-port fill 
and vent pipe, emitting an obvious petroleum odor, were observed on the eastern 
exterior wall of the building; these pipes are possibly connected to the 8,500 gallon 
fuel oil tank registered to the Site. The current property owner was not aware of any 
tanks on the property.  Finally, a 1995 JCO report associated with the neighboring 
Former Korner Pocket Site, indicated that elevated PID readings were reported in the 
northeast corner of the basement of the subject Site.  This report suggested that a 
7,500 gallon #2 fuel oil UST is present in this immediate area outside the northeast 
wall of the subject Site. 
 
Opinion:  It is the Environmental Professional’s opinion that there is a high 
likelihood that as many as three abandoned USTs exist at the Site. Should 
additional information regarding the presence of these USTs be desired, either 
exploratory test pitting and/or ground penetrating radar services could be used to 
evaluate the presence of these USTs. The State Vermont requires abandoned USTs 
be appropriately decommissioned.  If evidence of a release is confirmed during tank 
removal and additional information is desired regarding soil and groundwater 
quality in the vicinity of these USTs, soil and groundwater  samples could be 
collected and analyzed for VOCs, SVOCs, and possible lead (depending on the 
presumed age and residual contents of the tanks, i.e. old leaded gasoline). 
 
5. Floor pits: Four floor pits and what appeared to be a sewer clean out containing 
sediment were observed in the basement of the Site building.  
Opinion: It is the Environmental Professional’s opinion that there is a moderate 
chance that the sediment in these floor pits is contaminated. Should additional 
information regarding the presence of contamination in this sediment be desired, 
the contents of these pits and clean out could be screened for VOCs with a PID.  
Sediment present in the voids could also be sampled and analyzed of VOCs, PCBs, 
metals and PAHs to analytically confirm potential contaminant constitutes.  
 
6. Railroad Corridor: The Site is abutted by The Vermont Railway to the south. Considering the 
proximity to the tracks, it is likely that via atmospheric deposition, partially burnt 
hydrocarbons in the form of PAHs may be present in shallow soils on the Site.  Railroads 
also utilize herbicides to control vegetation along the rails and have historically used ACM in 
rail car brake systems.  
 
Opinion:  It is the Environmental Professional’s opinion that there is a moderate 
chance that the adjacent rail corridor has adversely impacted soil quality at the 
Site. Should additional information regarding the soil quality in the vicinity of the 
rail corridor be desired near surface soil samples could be collected in the southern 
portion of the Site and analyzed for PAHs, PCBs, metals, ACM and herbicides.   
 
7. Groundwater Related Neighboring Property:   The abutting hazardous waste site 
Former Korner Pocket [SMS#: 94-1727] has had reported groundwater impacts above 
the VGES.  Although the Korner Pocket site was closed by VTDEC in 2012, a 1995 
report for the site suggests the possible presence of VOC impacts and a UST outside 
the northeast corner of the building at the subject Site.   
  
Opinion:  It is the Environmental Professional’s opinion that there is a moderate 
chance that impacted groundwater from the Former Korner Pocket may have 
migrated and adversely impacted groundwater quality at the Site. Should additional 
information regarding groundwater quality be desired groundwater monitoring 
wells could be installed, samples collected, and analyzed for VOCs, SVOCs, and 
possibly PCBs.   
 
RECs beyond the Scope of ASTM 1527-13 and AAI 
   
1. Given the age of the building, LBP may coat surfaces of interior and exterior walls of 
the Site.  
  
Opinion: In order to confirm or deny the presence of LBP on Site, an inspection 
should be conducted by a certified lead paint inspector and a report generated 
outlining the findings. 
 
2. ACM was identified in the debris of the demolished Site building. Given the age and 
construction of the existing Site building, ACM may be present in that building as 
well.  
 
Opinion: An ACM inspection should be conducted by a certified ACM inspector 
and a report should be generated outlining the findings. This report should include 
a rough cost estimate for abatement of any ACM identified.  
 
Potential Offsite Issues for Consideration 
Neighboring Properties:  Eighteen hazardous waste sites (six active and twelve inactive) 
are located within a 0.25-mile radius of the Site.  The abutting site to the west (CVPSRutland
City Gas Works [SMS #: 77-0137]), identified groundwater impacts above the 
VGES and continues to be monitored due to elevated concentrations of PAHs, VOCs, 
and PCBs in groundwater.  Also, according to the 1962 and 1971 Sanborn maps, a former 
dry cleaner was located at 133 State Street, the current Foley Services Inc. [SMS #: 94
1627] property.  Although a petroleum assessment has been performed and subsurface 
petroleum impacts have been reported, no assessment has been conducted to evaluate the 
presence of chlorinated VOCs in the sub-surface.  Additionally, a former filling station 
and currently a laundry mat occupy the property located 147 State Street.   Although not 
a State listed hazardous site, JCO understands that no environmental assessment of this 
property has occurred.  
Opinion:  It is the Environmental Professional’s opinion that there is a possibility 
that impacted groundwater and/or vapor from neighboring properties may have 
migrated onto the Site. Should additional information regarding groundwater or 
vapor quality be desired groundwater monitoring wells and soil gas monitoring 
points could be installed, samples collected, and analyzed for VOCs, and possibly 
SVOCs, and PCBs.   
 
 
8.0 DATA GAPS/LIMITATIONS 
8.1 DATA GAPS 
 The property includes multiple parcels; ownership history for the parcels was 
difficult to track and the ownership history summarized in this report may include land 
transfers not including the subject parcels or may be incomplete. 
 
The 1962 and 1971 Sanborn Maps (the two most recent maps) include the label 
“Fuel Oil Tks Under Conc. Fl” on an enclosure off the east side of the demolished 
building, near the southeast corner of the building. There is no record of the presence of 
these tanks with the exception of the Sanborn maps.  The current property owner was not 
aware of any tanks on the property. The presence of USTs in this location could not be 
confirmed or denied.  
 
During the site visit on February 3, 2016 there was a snow cover of several inches 
on the ground, making it difficult to identify exterior features such as stressed vegetation, 
contents of debris piles, and small scale topographic features.  
 
Standing water was encountered in the former boiler room along the north wall of 
the building. Due to the water the condition of the floor could not be inspected during the 
Site visit. 
 
The majority of electrical equipment appeared to be removed from the building 
prior to the Site visit, so it is possible that transformers or other electrical devices that 
may have contained PCBs were once utilized at the facility and were since removed.  
Furthermore, Green Mountain Power does not have a record of the age or the 
composition of the dielectric fluid of the current pole-mounted transformers or former 
transformers (if applicable) located on the property. 
   
The property owner accepted fill on the Site from a stormwater construction 
project; according to the property owner the fill was temporarily stored on the southern 
portion of the property. Some remaining fill was observed on the foundation of the 
former building. The property owner stated that a construction company, Kingsbury 
Construction, provided the fill ensured that the fill was tested and was clean. No records 
were provided to corroborate that the fill was clean. 
 
Although these data gaps are important to note, it is the opinion of JCO that they 
did not significantly impact our ability to identify the RECs at the Site.  Should additional 
information be located or provided that is related to these data gaps JCO reserves the 
right to change our opinion.   
 
8.2 LIMITATIONS 
The conclusions of this ESA were based upon information obtained and made 
available to JCO from the following sources: the VT DEC; the Federal EPA; John 
Ruggiero (property owner); Elisabeth Kulas, Housing Trust of Rutland County; the 
Rutland Health Officer; and from information gathered during the Site reconnaissance.  

This information has been intended for the sole use of the RRPC for specific application
