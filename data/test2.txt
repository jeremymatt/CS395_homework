EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 
The Johnson Company, Inc., of Montpelier, Vermont was retained by Redstone to conduct a 
Phase I Environmental Site Assessment (ESA) of the parcels located at 9 Lakeview Terrace and 
85 North Avenue in Burlington, Vermont (the Property).   
 
This ESA was performed by personnel from The Johnson Company who meet the definition of 
Environmental Professional as defined in 40 CFR Part 312.  This ESA included reviewing 
existing documentation, available aerial photographs and topographic maps, determining the 
regulatory status of the Property, contacting appropriate personnel regarding past and present 
uses of the Property, investigating the potential for past releases of petroleum products and/or 
hazardous substances at the Property, and conducting a site reconnaissance to visually inspect 
accessible portions of the Property to ascertain the presence of recognized environmental 
conditions (RECs) in the form of present or potential release(s) of hazardous substances or 
petroleum products. In addition, the presence of historic recognized environmental conditions 
(HRECs) – a past release of hazardous substance(s) that has been addressed to residential use 
standards or unrestricted use criteria – and controlled recognized environmental conditions 
(CREC) – a past release of hazardous substance(s) that has been addressed to non-residential use 
standards and is subject to some type of control – were identified for the Property if applicable. 
To summarize, a HREC is no longer a REC; a CREC is a REC.  
 
As of March 6, 2015 summary of the regulatory status of the Property is as follows: 
· The Property is not a listed hazardous waste site  
· The Property is not a listed underground storage tank facility 
· The Property is not listed as a Resource Conservation and Recovery Act hazardous waste 
generator 
· No environmental liens or institutional controls were identified for the Property 
· No spills were identified at the Property in either State or federal databases 
· The Property is not listed with the USEPA On-scene Coordinator program 
· The Property is not a listed Brownfields redevelopment property 
 
An initial Property reconnaissance conducted by The Johnson Company on March 6, 2015 
included an inspection of interior and exterior portions of the Property.  Photographs of Property 
conditions that day are provided in this report. 
 
The Johnson Company understands that a prospective purchaser is interested in performing 
environmental due diligence activities in support of a potential transfer of ownership. 
 
The Johnson Company has performed this Phase I Environmental Site Assessment in 
conformance with the scope and limitations of ASTM Practice E-1527-13 of 9 Lakeview Terrace  
and 85 North Avenue in Burlington, Vermont.  Any exception to, or deletions from, this practice 
are described in Section 8.1 of this report.  This assessment has revealed no evidence of RECs in 
connection with the property except for the following (Note: the following is a summary of 
identified RECs; additional details are provided in Section 7.0 of the report):  
 
RECS: 
 
1. The soils beneath the parking lot consist of fill contaminated with metals and polycyclic 
aromatic hydrocarbons above regulatory screening levels.  Material described as “white, 
possibly fibrous” was encountered in soil borings advanced through this fill.  Further 
investigation should be conducted to investigate the degree and extent of contamination in 
this fill material. 
 
RECs beyond the Scope of ASTM 1527-05 and AAI 
 
Based on the age and construction of the 9 Lakeview Terrace building and on the Sanborn Fire 
Insurance maps, asbestos-containing building materials, lead-based paint, and/or polychlorinated 
biphenyl-containing building materials may be present in this building.  Inspections should be 
conducted to confirm if this is the case. 
 
1.0 INTRODUCTION 
The Johnson Company was retained by the Redstone to conduct a Phase I Environmental 
Site Assessment (ESA) of two distinct parcels located at 9 Lakeview Terrace and 85 North 
Avenue in Burlington, Vermont, which together are referred to herein as the Property.  The 
location of the Property is depicted in Figure 1.  
 
The purpose of the ESA was to identify recognized environmental conditions (RECs) 
associated with the Property that indicate the presence or likely presence of hazardous substances 
or petroleum products under conditions that indicate an existing release, past release, or a 
material threat of a release associated with the Property.  This ESA included reviewing existing 
information made available and/or that was reasonably ascertainable regarding current and past 
usage of the property, determining the Property’s regulatory status, contacting appropriate 
personnel regarding current and past uses of the Property, investigating the potential for past 
releases of petroleum products and/or hazardous substances on the Property, and conducting an 
onsite reconnaissance to visually inspect the accessible portions of the Property.   
 
This ESA was performed by personnel from The Johnson Company who meet the 
definition of Environmental Professional as defined in 40 CFR Part 312, in conformance within 
the scope and limitations of  ASTM E 1527-13 and in compliance with 40 CFR Part 312, 
Standards and Practices for All Appropriate Inquiries.   
 
Credentials of The Johnson Company personnel involved with the preparation of this 
ESA are included as Appendix 1. 
 
2.0 PROPERTY DESCRIPTION 
2.1 SETTING AND SURROUNDING DEVELOPMENT 
The Property was formerly owned by Burlington College and consists of an 
approximately 0.1 acre parcel located on the south side of Lakeview Terrace (9 Lakeview 
Terrace) and an approximately 1.1 acre parcel located on the south side of North Avenue (85 
North Avenue). Ownership of the 9 Lakeview Terrace parcel has been transferred to EF Farrell, 
LLC and the 85 North Ave parcel is currently owned by 85 North Ave, LLC.  The 85 North 
Avenue parcel is located directly east of the 9 Lakeview Terrace parcel.  The parcels are bound 
by residential buildings to the north, by a sloped wooded area to the south and west, and by 
Lakeview Terrace and North Avenue to the east.  The surrounding neighborhood is zoned largely 
as medium density residential with a corridor of light commercial along North Avenue.  The 
Property is relatively flat topographically, with the exception of portions to the south and west 
which contain a steep, wooded slope which divides the residential neighborhood from the Lake 
Champlain waterfront approximately 100 vertical feet below. The waterfront has historically 
been utilized as an industrial area and is situated at the foot of the escarpment between the 
Property and Lake Champlain. The nearest body of water is Lake Champlain, which is located 
approximately 500 feet west of the Property. 
 
The 9 Lakeview Terrace parcel currently hosts a residential building and the 85 North 
Avenue parcel currently hosts a parking lot.  The Burlington Tax Assessor’s sheet lists the date 
of construction of the residential building as circa 1899. The building currently consists of five 
apartment units, four of which are occupied by Burlington College students. The Johnson 
Company understands that Redstone, a prospective purchaser, is interested in performing 
environmental due diligence in support of a potential transfer of property ownership.  An aerial 
photograph that shows the Property relative to its immediate surroundings is provided as Figure 
2.  
 
2.2 HEATING, WATER AND SEWER 
As of March 6, 2015, the building was serviced by municipal water and sewer.  The 
building is currently heated using wall-mounted natural gas heaters (gas provided by Vermont 
Gas Systems).  Hot water is provided to each apartment by individual natural gas water heaters 
located in the basement.  Historical heat sources are not known, but a brick chimney is located in 
the center of the building, which suggests wood and/or coal heat.  Electricity for the Property is 
provided by Burlington Electric. 
 
2.3 GEOLOGY AND HYDROGEOLOGY 
The surficial geology at the Property is mapped as Adams and Windsor loamy sands with 
a 0 to 5 percent slope (NRCS, 2010).  The bedrock in the area is mapped as Dunham dolomite, a 
Lower Cambrian formation of siliceous dolomite (VT DEC1, 2015).  
 
Subsurface information was available from boring logs prepared by Knight Engineers, 
who advanced the borings on site.  According to the logs, two borings were advanced in the 
parking lot; these borings identified imported fill of depths between 22-35 feet below ground 
surface (fbgs).  This fill material contained asphalt/tar, bricks, wood and/or cement chunks 
(Knight, 2001).  Further subsurface information was available from the March 1, 2007 
Geodesign feasibility study, which found that the upper layer of soils at the Site consist of “nonengineered
fill” with a thickness of 17-35 feet.  Geodesign reported that this fill contained ashes, 
cinders, and “white possibly fibrous” material (Geodesign, 2007).   
 
The direction of groundwater flow or hydraulic gradient was not measured as part of this 
Phase I ESA. However, based on the local topography, river flow directions, and the Property’s 
proximity to Lake Champlain, the groundwater flow direction is expected to be to the west and 
southwest towards the lake. Additionally, the depth to groundwater is expected to be fairly deep 
considering the rapid elevation change on the Property and the proximity to Lake Champlain.  It 
is possible that localized flow patterns on the Property may vary from regional groundwater flow 
directions due to influences from the Winooski River to the north and east and urban 
development around the Property. 

2.4 THREATENED SPECIES AND WETLANDS 
According to the Vermont Agency of Natural Resources (ANR) Natural Resources Atlas, 
there are six rare, threatened, or endangered species that may potentially reside within 0.5 miles 
of the nearest Property boundary.  All six of these species are listed as “vascular plants”; the ID 
numbers are: 4139, 6147, 583, 9002, 513, and 265. 
 
Two Significant Natural Communities are mapped within 0.5 miles of the nearest 
Property boundary. The first is a Lake Sand Beach (ID: 1754) that is categorized as a terrestrial 
natural community and is located along the shoreline northwest of the Property. The second is a 
Cattail Marsh (ID: 5713) that is categorized as a palustrine natural community and is a wetland 
location northeast of the Property. 
 
Two wetlands are located within 0.5 miles from the nearest Property boundary. The first 
is a class 2 wetland with object ID 21310 and is approximately 1,500 feet northeast of the 
Property. The second is a class 2 wetland with object ID 21394 and is located approximately 
1,800 feet northeast of the Property. All information was accessed on February 27, 2015 (VT 
DEC1, 2015). 
 
3.0 PROPERTY HISTORY AND REVIEW OF EXISTING INFORMATION 
3.1 HISTORICAL REVIEW 
The earliest known use of the Property was identified in the Sanborn maps which 
suggested the first use of the Property was as a residential property.  This was confirmed during 
review of the Manning’s Street Directories. 
  
3.1.1 Land Records 
A search of the Land Records at the Burlington City Clerk’s office was conducted by 
Jeremy Matt (JCO) on March 6, 2015.  Table 1 provides a summary of the ownership history for 
the Property.  Note that the 85 North Ave parcel is presumed to be the property identified as 
Depot Street in the land records. 
 
3.1.2 U.S.G.S. Topographic Maps 
The 1906 (reprinted 1943) and 1948 Burlington, Vermont (VT) 15-minute topographic 
quadrangle maps, and the 1987 Burlington, VT 7.5-minute United States Geological Survey 
(USGS) topographic quadrangle map were reviewed as part of this ESA.  The topographic 
contours on the 1906 map indicate that the steep slope along southern border of the parking lot 
was situated further to the south with respect to its current location.  This map shows a structure 
approximately at 9 Lakeview Terrace as well as a structure at the south end of Lakeview Terrace 
in the vicinity of the Print Shop shown on the 1926 Sanborn maps (see Section 3.1.4).  The 1948 
map illustrates that the toe of the escarpment had been cut back similar to its current 
configuration in order to provide space for a building at the foot of Depot Street.  The 1948 map 
also shows a structure at the approximate location of 9 Lakeview Terrace.  However, the 
structure at the south end of Lakeview Terrace is not present.  The 1987 map shows the land and 
buildings at the Site in their current configuration.  All maps show the railroad at the foot of the 
escarpment in its current position (USGS1, 2015).  
 
3.1.3 Aerial Photographs 
A State of Vermont low-altitude aerial photograph (VT-62-L 9-156) of the Property from 
1962 and digital ortho-photographs from 1999, 2003, 2004, 2006, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, and 
2012 (GoogleEarth, 2015) were reviewed as part of this ESA. An undated ESRI ortho photo was 
also acquired.  The ESRI orthophoto layer has been used as a base map for Figure 2.  The date of 
the ESRI ortho photo was not provided, but based on the configuration of nearby properties the 
Figure 2 orthophoto appears to be circa 2012.  The building appears in its current configuration 
in all orthophotos.   

3.1.4 Sanborn Fire Insurance Maps 
The Sanborn Fire Insurance Maps representing the Property were purchased from 
Environmental Data Resources (EDR), and the available maps (1889, 1894, 1900, 1906, 1912, 
1919, 1926, 1938, 1942, 1950, 1960, 1978, and 1989) were reviewed.  Copies of these maps are 
provided in Appendix 2.   
 
The maps published in 1900 and before use North Avenue and the escarpment as their 
western and eastern limits, respectively, and do not include the Site.  These early maps do show 
extensive lumber industry and railroad infrastructure along the lakeshore to the south and west of 
the Site as early as 1885. 
 
Considerable development occurred along the lakeshore and further inland during the late 
nineteenth-century, but according to the Sanborn maps the Site remained undeveloped.  The 
1906 map is the earliest to show the local streets (Lakeview Terrace (formerly called Bissell), 
Haswell, North Ave, etc.) in their current configuration, although the parking lot on the 85 North 
Ave parcel does not appear to be present.  The 1919 edition was the earliest of the maps to show 
a dwelling on the Property.  This map appears to show the 9 Lakeview Terrace structure in its 
approximate current configuration. A small printing shop appears at the southern end of 
Lakeview Terrace (on the 85 North Ave parcel) in the 1926 edition.  In the 1938 edition, the 
print shop structure still exists but is appears to be labeled “A” (automobile garage).  A second 
small automobile garage south of 9 Lakeview Terrace and west of the print shop appears on the 
85 North Ave parcel in the 1938 edition. These garages are present in the 1942, 1950, and 1960 
maps but are not present in the 1978 or 1989 maps.  It should be noted that the 1942 through 
1989 maps show the 9 Lakeview Terrace structure as being “asbestos clad”. 
 
Lumber yards and a rail yard occupy the foot of the escarpment in all maps between 1885 
and 1926.  A railroad roundhouse and repair shop appears at the rail yard immediately southwest 
of the Site along the toe of the escarpment in the 1926 edition and remains present in the 1989 
edition.  Additional railroad activities appear along the Lake Champlain waterfront in the vicinity 
of the Site for all years after 1926. 
 
3.1.5 Manning’s Street Directory 
The Manning’s Street Directories for Burlington, VT, available at the Vermont Law 
Library, were reviewed for the years of 1870, 1874, 1877-78, 1881-83, 1885, 1887, 1889, 1900, 
1919, 1929, 1925, 1939, 1949, 1960, 1969, and 1979. This resource provided a chronological 
operational history for a particular address.  The directories between 1870 and 1889 did not list 
Lakeview Terrace as a street.  The 1900 directory listed Lakeview Terrace as Bissell Street, but 
did not provide an index of street numbers.  The 1919 directory resident listed 9 Bissell Street as 
a single-resident address.  The 1925 through 1969 directories listed 9 Lakeview Terrace as a 3unit
residential address.  The 1979 directory provided 5 listings for the 9 Lakeview Terrace 
address.  No non-residential uses of the Property were identified. 
 
3.1.6 Environmental Questionnaire 
The Johnson Company’s standard environmental questionnaire was completed by Ms. 
Coralee A. Holm, Director of Community & Alumni Relations, Burlington College, on March 6, 
2015. A copy of the questionnaire has been included as Appendix 3. 
 
3.2 INTERVIEWS 
3.2.1 Current Owner/Occupant 
The current occupant of the building is Burlington College.  During the March 6, 2015 
Property Walkover, Mr. Greg Litchfield of Burlington College was interviewed by Mr. Jeremy 
Matt (of JCO) regarding the Property.  Mr. Litchfield indicated that the current property uses 
included student rental housing in the structure at 9 Lakeview Terrace and the parking lot on the 
85 North Ave parcel.  Mr. Litchfield was not aware of any non-residential historical uses of the 
Property. 

3.2.2 Past Owner/Occupant 
The previous owner of the Property is Burlington College, Mr. Greg Litchfield of 
Burlington college was interviewed on March 6, 2015 (see Section 3.2.1 above).  No other past 
owners or occupants were interviewed as part of this ESA. 
 
3.2.3 State/Local Officials 
The Burlington Fire Marshal, the Burlington Health Officer and the Burlington Police 
Chief were contacted regarding the Property by Mr. Jeremy Matt (JCO).  Details of these 
interviews are provided in Sections 4.4.1, 4.4.2, and 4.4.3, below.  
 
3.2.4 Neighboring or Nearby Property Owner/Occupant 
Neighboring property owners were not contacted as part of this assessment. 
 
3.3 PRIOR INVESTIGATIONS 
3.3.1 Unknown Date – Knight Construction Engineering Soil Boring Package 
 Knight Construction Engineers of Williston Vermont performed a soil boring 
investigation in the Depot Street area which included advancement of soil borings at the southern 
edge of the parking lot on the 85 North Ave parcel.  The exact date of this investigation is not 
known but one of the boring logs includes a date (12/20/2001).  However, the fax transmittal of 
the boring logs is dated November 1, 2006, so the investigation occurred prior to that date.  This 
investigation did not include field screening of soils or the collection of environmental samples.  
The focus appears to have been to investigate the structural qualities of the soils in the 
investigation area (Knight, 2006) 
 
3.3.2 November 20, 2006 – Johnson Company DRAFT Phase I ESA 
 The Johnson Company performed a Phase I ESA for Burlington College which included 
assessments of the 9 Lakeview Terrace and 85 North Ave parcels (among others).  This report 
was never finalized; the DRAFT version of the report is dated November 20, 2006 (JCO, 2006).  
Concerns identified in this report include nearby industrial activities (the Moran coal-fired power 
plant, lumber yards, railroad activity, etc.), the potential for contaminated fill to have been used 
beneath the parking lot, the potential for contamination from a leaking UST at the 95 North Ave 
property to have impacted the Site, and the potential for the building to contain lead-based paint 
and/or asbestos. 
 
3.3.3 March 1, 2007 – Geodesign Incorporated 
On February 23, 2007 Geodesign Incorporated of South Burlington, VT conducted soil 
boring report which included advancement of soil borings in the parking lot of the 85 North Ave 
parcel.  This investigation included field screen of soils with a photo-ionization detector (PID).  
The PID screening results were reported less than 16 ppmV in all locations and most locations 
were less than 10 ppmV.  A petroleum odor was noted in one boring, but the associated PID 
reading was relatively low (9.2 ppmV).  In general, the boring logs did not identify any evidence 
of gross petroleum contamination such as free product or oily sheens.  As discussed in Section 
2.3, these borings found that the parking lot is underlain by 17-35 feet of fill.  This fill included 
“ashes/cinders/white possibly fibrous material.  Geodesign collected and stored samples for 
laboratory analysis (Geodesign, 2007).   
 
The samples collected by Geodesign were transported to Eastern Analytical of Concord, 
NH for laboratory analysis.  Note that the samples were received by the laboratory on March 5, 
2007, and the P-1 S6(15-17’) and P-3 (0-2) samples were analyzed out of the 14-day hold time 
for volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and total petroleum hydrocarbons.  The P-3 sample, 
which reportedly exhibited a petroleum odor, was found to contain toluene, xylenes, 
trimethylbenzenes, and 1,2-dichlorobenzene at relatively low concentrations (less than 200 
milligrams per kilogram; ug/kg).  These compounds are petroleum-related.  Note that the P-3 
sample is located nearest to the leaking UST which was removed from the 95 North Ave 
property (see Section 4.3.2).  The S-2 sample did not contain detectable VOCs above the 50 
ug/kg reporting limit.  In addition to the VOC analysis, samples were analyzed for metals and 
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs).  The reported concentrations were compared to the 
January 2015 USEPA Regional Screening Levels and to the residential soil screening levels 
provided by the Vermont Department of Health; all samples collected from the parking lot 
contained exceedances of at least one PAH and at least one metal (JCO, 2007).   
 
4.0 REGULATORY STATUS 
4.1 ENVIRONMENTAL LIENS 
A search of the files at the Burlington Town Clerk’s office on March 6, 2015 revealed no 
environmental liens on the property.  
 
4.2 FEDERAL REGULATORY FILES 
4.2.1 Federal National Priority List (NPL) 
According to the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) website, which provided 
information extracted on February 27, 2015, the Property is not listed on the NPL (also known as 
Superfund) as an active site.  A portion of The Pine Street Barge Canal (a Superfund site with 
free-phase coal-tar contamination) is located approximately 1-mile from the Property.  No other 
properties within a 1.0 mile radius are listed on the NPL (EPA1, 2015; EPA2, 2015; EPA8, 
2015).   
 
4.2.1.1 Delisted NPL sites  
 Neither the Property nor any other properties within the 0.5-mile search radius from the 
nearest property boundary are delisted or partially delisted NPL sites (EPA2, 2015; EPA8, 2015). 
  
 
4.2.2 Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Information 
System (CERCLIS) List 
The Property does not appear on the CERCLIS list.  The Burlington Municipal Disposal 
Grounds (EPA Registry ID: 110009259783) is listed as a “Superfund (non-NPL)” Site and is 
located approximately 0.5 miles northeast of the Property.  No other CERCLIS-listed sites are 
located within a 0.5-mile search radius of the nearest property boundary (EPA1, 2015; EPA8, 
2015).  
 
4.2.2.1 No Further Remedial Action Planned (NFRAP) Site List 
Neither the Property nor any properties within a 0.5-mile search radius from the nearest 
property boundary are listed as CERCLIS designated sites with a NFRAP status (EPA3, 2015; 
EPA8, 2015).   
 
4.2.3 Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) Generators 
According to the ANR Natural Resource Atlas, the Property is not listed as a RCRA 
generator.  The McGaffrey’s Sunoco property located at 98 North Ave (opposite the Property) is 
listed as a conditionally exempt small quantity generator (CE SQG) with handler ID 
VT50000002337.  A generator by the name of “Star Press” is also mapped on near the Property 
on North Ave, but this facility does not appear to be an active generator.  Neither the Waste 
Management Division Interactive Database (WM-ID) nor the EPA Envirofacts Warehouse list 
any additional properties either adjacent to or in the immediate vicinity of the Property.  Table 2 
below summarizes the RCRA generators near the Property (EPA4, 2013; VT DEC1, 2015; VT 
DEC2, 2015; EPA8, 2015).   
 
4.2.3.1 RCRA Corrective Action Sites (CORRACTS) List 
No CORRACTS are located within a 1.0-mile search radius from the nearest property 
boundary of the Property (EPA5, 2015).  
 
4.2.4 RCRA Treatment, Storage and Disposal (TSD) Facilities 
There are no non-CORRACTS transportation and disposal (TSD) facilities listed within a 
0.5-mile search radius from the nearest property boundary of the Property (EPA4, 2015; VT 
DEC1, 2015).  

4.2.5 Federal Institutional Control/Engineering Registries 
As of the date of this report, the EPA was developing the Institutional Controls Tracking 
System and the system had not yet been implemented (EPA6, 2012).  
 
4.2.6 Federal Emergency Response Notification (ERNS) List 
According to the ERNS list, there were no reported spills or releases of hazardous 
materials or petroleum products at the Property (RTK, 2015).   
 
4.2.7 EPA On-scene Coordinator Program 
The EPA On-scene Coordinator (EPA OSC) program performs rapid responses to remove 
direct contact risks by trespassers or the public.  As of March 5, 2015, no sites within a 1.0-mile 
search radius of the nearest property boundary are listed on the EPA OSC website (EPAOSC, 
2013).  
 
4.3 STATE/TRIBAL REGULATORY FILES 
 There are no recognized tribal or American Indian-owned lands within Vermont; 
therefore, no tribal files were searched during this ESA.   
 
4.3.1 Vermont Sites Management Section Hazardous Sites List 
 The Property is not listed by the VTDEC Sites Management Section (SMS) as a 
hazardous waste site.  A radius search of the ANR Natural Resource Atlas returned a total of 86 
additional hazardous waste sites within 1.0-mile of the nearest Property boundary. Of these, 46 
are inactive (closed) with Site Management Activity Completed (SMAC) or No Further Action 
Planned (NFAP) designation.  The SMAC or NFAP status indicates that environmental 
assessment and/or management has been performed on a property to the extent that the VTDEC 
does not see a need for additional management activity at the time the designation letter was 
issued.  However, an inactive site may be reopened should additional information become 
available or applicable regulatory standards change. No additional hazardous waste sites were 
identified on the EPA “MyMaps for MyEnvironment” mapping tool (EPA8, 2013).  A total of 5 
(3 inactive and 2 active) sites are located within 0.25-mile of the Property (VT DEC1, 2013).  
Table 3 and Table 4 summarize the active and inactive hazardous wastes sites located within 1.0mile
of the nearest Property boundary, respectively. The information provided in these tables 
was extracted from the ANR Natural Research Atlas on March 4, 2015 and from the EPA 
“MyMaps for MyEnvironment” on March 4, 2015.  
 
 
4.3.2 Nearby Properties of Interest 
The properties were identified as being of potential environmental concern based on 
proximity to the Site. The properties of interest discussed below are shown on Figure 2. 
 
95 North Ave: Burlington College (SMS #: 962048) 
The Burlington College Site was listed as a hazardous waste Site as a result of 
contamination encountered during closure of a 1,000-gallon heating oil underground 
storage tank (UST).  An August 4, 1997 report by Twin State Environmental Corp. of 
Richmond, VT reported that Photoionization Detector (PID) readings of up to 26 parts 
per million by volume (ppmV) were encountered during UST removal and that all 
“visibly contaminated” soil was also removed from the Site and disposed of “under 
manifest”.  Subsequent follow-up investigation conducted by Twin State included 
advancement of three soil borings; all PID screening results for this investigation were 
reported to be <1ppmV (Twin State, 1997).  Following review of this investigation the 
VTDEC issued a SMAC letter on March 24, 1998.  Based on the results of the soil 
Twin Sate investigation, it is unlikely that contamination from this UST has migrated 
onto the Property. 
 
98 North Ave: McGaffrey’s Sunoco (SMS #: 941698) 
The McGaffrey’s Sunoco Site was listed by the VTDEC as a hazardous waste 
site as a result of petroleum contamination encountered during closure of three 6,000
gallon gasoline USTs.  During UST closure, stained soils and soils with PID screening 
values as high as 200 ppmV were encountered.  No free product was encountered and 
groundwater was not encountered.  The Tank Pull Summary Report prepared by Griffin 
International indicated that all contaminated soils exhibiting elevated PID results were 
excavated stockpiled on-site (Griffin, 1994).  Following three rounds of monitoring of 
the stockpiled soils, the VTDEC issued a SMAC letter on December 1, 1998.  The 
SMAC letter stated that the VTDEC had determined that 1) the source of contamination 
had been adequately characterized and remediated and that; and 2) that the site does not 
pose an unreasonable risk to human health or the environment (VTDEC, 1998).  Based 
on the SMAC letter and the results of the Griffin report it is unlikely that contamination 
from these USTs has migrated onto the Property. 
 
Industrial Activities on the Burlington Waterfront 
The section of waterfront between the Property and Lake Champlain has seen a 
wide variety of industrial activities, including a coal-fired power plant, railroad 
activities, lumber yard activities, and bulk petroleum storage and transport.  This area 
includes three listed hazardous waste Sites: the Moran Plant (SMS ID: 20053357), the 
North 40 Urban Reserve (SMS ID: 941585), and Burlington Electric (SMS ID: 
900540).  Given that the Property is significantly higher in elevation than the 
waterfront, it is unlikely that any soil or groundwater contamination resulting from 
these activities has impacted the Property.  However, these industrial activities may 
have resulted in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) impacts to the Property 
through aerial deposition. 
 
4.3.3 Underground Storage Tank List 
The Property is not listed as a UST facility by the VTDEC. (VT DEC1, 2015; VT DEC2, 
2015).   

The 95 North Ave (located adjacent to the 85 North Ave parking lot) is not a registered 
UST facility, but a 1,000-gallon UST was removed from that property on August 19, 1996 (see 
Section 4.3.2 above for additional details).   
 
The McGaffrey’s Sunoco site located at 98 North Ave is a registered UST facility with 
ID: 1797.  Additional details are provided in Section 4.3.2 above.  There are currently two active 
10,000-gallon gasoline USTs at the facility, each of which contains a 6,000-gallon and a 4,000gallon
compartment.  A total of five USTs have been removed from this facility: three 6,000gallon
gasoline USTs, one 1,000-gallon used oil UST and one 1,000-gallon fuel oil UST.  Table 
5 is the UST summary table from the VTDEC Waste Management Interactive Database for the 
McGaffrey’s Sunoco facility (provided verbatim).  
 
4.3.4 Spills List 
According to the WM-ID and MyMaps for MyEnvironment, no spills have occurred on 
the Property (VT DEC2, 2015; EPA8, 2015).  
 
4.3.5 Landfills 
 There are two landfills within 0.5 miles of the nearest Property boundary. The first is the 
Burlington City Landfill with object ID 940, which was closed in 1990 and is located 
approximately 2,260 feet northeast of the Property.  Based on the location of the Burlington City 
Landfill and on the ground topography between the landfill and the Property, the landfill does 
not appear to be hydraulically up-gradient of the Property.  The second is a closed landfill with 
object ID 943 and is located approximately 1,230 feet southeast of the Property. The acreage of 
this landfill is listed as 0.0 acres.  No other information is listed for this landfill.  This landfill 
appears to be hydraulically cross-gradient to the Property (EPA7, 1995; VT DEC1, 2015; VT 
DEC2, 2015; VT DEC3, 2006). Based on the locations of these landfills relative to the Property 
it is unlikely that contamination from these features has migrated onto the Property. 

4.3.6 Institutional Controls/Engineering Controls Registries 
An investigation of the records available at the Burlington Town Clerk’s office revealed 
that no institutional and/or engineering controls had been filed in the Land Records for the 
Property as of March 6, 2015.  
 
4.3.7 Voluntary Cleanup Sites 
Vermont does not specifically have a voluntary cleanup program, but the Brownfield 
Reuse Environmental Liability Limitation Act (BRELLA, effective July 1, 2008), acts as one for 
non-responsible parties.  An application has been submitted to enroll the Property in the 
Brownfield program.  Additional details regarding Brownfield properties in the vicinity of the 
Property are provided in Section 4.3.8. 
 
4.3.8 Brownfield Sites 
As of March 6, 2015, an application has been submitted to enroll the Property in the 
Brownfield program.  Table 3 provides information regarding VTDEC-listed Brownfield sites 
within 1-mile of the Property.  Two active Brownfield Sites (the North 40 Urban Reserve and the 
Moran Plant) are located within 0.25-mile of the Property.  The VTDEC lists 5 additional 
Brownfield sites within 1-mile of the property.  In addition to the VTDEC listed Brownfield 
sites, the USEPA lists 31 additional Brownfield properties. Table 3 provides details regarding 
VTDEC-listed Brownfield properties.  Table 6 provides information on Brownfield sites listed 
by the USEPA only.  (VT DEC1, 2013; VT DEC2, 2013; EPA8, 2013).   
 
4.4 LOCAL REGULATORY FILES 
4.4.1 Police Department 
At the request of Police Chief Michael Schirling, the Burlington Police records were 
searched by Assistant Crime Prevention Analyst Jacob Oblak of the Burlington Police 
Department.  On March 6, 2015 Mr. Oblak sent an email indicating that the Burlington Police 
Department had no records of calls relating to the Property (Oblak, 2015).  

4.4.2 Health Officer  
The Burlington Health Officer, Mr. William Ward, interviewed by telephone on March 
12, 2015 by Mr. Jeremy Matt of The Johnson Company.  Mr. Ward searched the records 
available to him and was not able to find any record of complaints at the Property.  However, 
Mr. Ward did note that there was a building permit dated August 1, 1988 (Reference Number: 
9206) for re-siding the structure with vinyl siding.  This permit stated “Asbestos siding removed 
8/2/88” (Ward, 2015).  
 
4.4.3 Fire Department 
The Burlington Fire Marshal, Mr. Barry Simays searched the fire department records for 
incidents at the Property.  Incidents reported included two fires involving items left on heaters 
(no damage to structure or contents during each fire) and one report of a brush fire (no other 
information was provided).  Mr. Simays noted that the database only goes back as far as January 
1, 2004.  Mr. Simays did not reference any other incidents at the Property (Simays, 2015). 
 
4.4.3 Local Electric Utility Company 
Electrical service to the building at 9 Lakeview Terrace is provided from power lines 
located along the west side of Lakeview Terrace.  Two utility poles are located at the Property, 
but neither had transformers and no visible indication of historical transformers was noted.  On 
March 13, 2015, Mr. Roger Donegan of Burlington Electric was interviewed by telephone.  Mr. 
Donegan indicated that to the best of his knowledge there were never Burlington Electric 
transformers located on that Property (Donegan, 2015). 
 
4.5 POLYCHLORINATED BIPHENYLS 
A materials inspection for polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) containing building materials 
was not performed as part of this ESA.  However, given the age and construction of the building 
it is possible that PCB-containing caulks, paints, sealants, florescent light ballasts, or other 
building materials are present in the building.  

4.6 NON-AAI/ASTM SCOPE CONSIDERATIONS 
4.6.1 Asbestos and Lead Paint Issues 
A lead based paint assessment was not performed as part of this ESA, given the age and 
construction of the building lead-based paints may be present at the Property.  Similarly, a 
formal asbestos assessment was not performed as part of this ESA.  However, given the age and 
construction of the building and the historical Sanborn maps which indicate that the structure 
was asbestos clad, asbestos may be present in the 9 Lakeview Terrace structure.  In addition, a 
“white possibly fibrous” material was encountered in soil borings advanced by Geodesign, Inc. 
of South Burlington, Vermont.  Asbestos analysis was not performed on this material.   
 
4.7 HISTORIC RECOGNIZED ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITION (HREC) 
 A HREC is defined by ASTM in the E1527-13 standard as “a past release of hazardous 
substance(s) that has been addressed to the satisfaction of the applicable regulatory authority or 
meeting unrestricted use criteria established by a regulatory authority, without subjecting the 
property to any required controls (for example, property use restrictions, activity and use 
limitations, institutional controls, or engineering controls).” HRECs are not considered RECs. 
 
 No HRECs were identified at the Property. 
 
5.0 PROPERTY RECONNAISSANCE 
A Property reconnaissance was conducted on March 6, 2015 by Mr. Jeremy Matt of The 
Johnson Company, Inc.  Mr. Matt was accompanied by Mr. Greg Litchfield of Burlington 
College.  The weather conditions during the visit were sunny and approximately 25 degrees 
Fahrenheit.   Property conditions on the day of the Property visit are documented in the 
photograph plates included as Appendix 4 of this report.    

The Property reconnaissance included an inspection of accessible interior and exterior 
portions of the Property.  The Property walkover was a non-intrusive investigation that focused 
on identifying indications of any existing or potential risks to human health or the environment.   
 
5.1   EXTERIOR OBSERVATIONS 
The northern portion of the Property is relatively flat and houses a single multi-unit 
residential structure to the west and a paved parking area to the east.  No storm drains were 
observed in the parking lot; the lot appears to be graded such that water runs to the wooded bank 
to the south or Depot Street to the east.  In addition to the paved parking area, a grassy area 
immediately south of the building was plowed and appears to be used for additional parking.  A 
small patch of staining was observed, presumably motor oil drips from an automobile.   
 
The southern portion of the Property consists of a steep wooded bank.  This bank could 
not be completely inspected due to the snow cover which was present on the day of the Site 
walkover.  However, concrete blocks and a variety of other trash (boxes, the carcass of a cathode 
ray tube style TV, etc. were observed.  These observations are consistent with the conditions 
observed during the walkover done by The Johnson Company for the DRAFT 2007 Phase I 
ESA. 
 
The building exterior is clapboard-sided and appears to be in good condition.  The roof of 
the eastern portion is slate and is sloped.  Western portions of the roof are flat and are 
presumably membrane roofs of some style.  However, the roof was not accessed as part of this 
ESA. 
 
5.2   INTERIOR OBSERVATIONS 
 The interior of the 9 Lakeview Terrace building is separated in to five apartments, all of 
which are heated with natural gas wall heaters.  Four of these apartments are currently occupied 
and therefore only a cursory inspection was performed in these areas.  These apartments 
appeared to be typical of college student housing and no evidence of environmental concerns 
was observed in the living spaces.   
  
 The basement was divided into and eastern and a western portion, both of which were 
largely empty.  Paint cans were observed in both spaces and a single used oil filter was present 
on a shelf in the western portion.  Five natural gas water heaters (one for each apartment) were 
located in the eastern portion.  The floor of the western portion and of part of the eastern portion 
of the basement was cracked concrete.  No floor drains were observed.  The western half of the 
eastern basement was of crushed stone.  Fiberglass bat insulation was present between the floor 
joists above each of the basement sections. 
 
 A brick chimney was observed in the middle of the building, suggesting that the structure 
was originally heated with either wood or coal.   
 
 A small (approximately 1ft by 1.5 ft) access hatch was observed in the ceiling of the 
eastern-most second floor apartment.  This reportedly provides access to unused attic space.  
However, no ladder was available and this space was not inspected. 
 
6.0  USER RESPONSIBILITIES 
In order to qualify for one of the Landowner Liability Protections (LLP) offered by the 
Small Business Liability Relief and Brownfields Revitalization Act of 2001, the user must 
provide the following information (if available) to the environmental professional: 
 
1. Environmental cleanup liens that are filed or recorded against the Property; 
2. Activity and land use limitations that are in place on the Property or that have 
been filed or recorded in a registry; 
3. Specialized knowledge or experience of the person seeking to qualify for the 
LLPs; 
4. Relationship of the purchase price to the fair market value of the property if it 
were not contaminated; 
5. Commonly known or reasonably ascertainable information about the property;  
6. The degree of obviousness of the presence or likely presence of contamination at 
the property and the ability to detect the contamination by appropriate 
investigation. 
 
All of the information listed above was addressed by Justin Dextradeur, Development 
Manager, Redstone, and provided to The Johnson Company.  A copy of a completed User 
Questionnaire pertaining to the Property has been included with this report as Appendix 5. 
 
7.0 RECOGNIZED ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS & OPINIONS 
The Johnson Company has performed a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment in 
conformance with the scope and limitations of ASTM Practice E-1527 of the property located at 
9 Lakeview Terrace and 85 North Street (the Property).  Any exception to, or deletions from, 
this practice are described in Section 8.1 of this report.  This assessment has revealed no 
evidence of recognized environmental conditions in connection with the property except for the 
following:    
 
RECS: 
 
1. Based on the results of the Geodesign soil borings which were advanced in February, 2007, 
the soils beneath the parking lot appears to consist of fill which is contaminated with metals 
and PAHs at concentrations above industrial soil screening levels and VOCs were detected at 
concentrations below soil screening levels.  In addition, “white, possibly fibrous” material, 
which may be asbestos-containing, was encountered in soil borings.  Possible sources of this 
contamination include aerial deposition of PAHs from nearby historical industrial activities, 
importation of contaminated fill, and/or drips/spills from leaking automobiles.  The surface 
of the parking lot currently provides a partial isolation barrier preventing contact with this 
material.  
 
Opinion:  Should additional information regarding the subsurface soil conditions be 
desired additional soil borings and sampling may be warranted to further characterize and 
delineate the extent of the metals, PAH, and VOC impacts and to determine if the 
composition of the white fibrous material identified during previous assessment.  
 
Given the limited data available, it is the opinion of the environmental professional that if 
isolated and or managed off-site appropriately, this soil poses little risk to human health or 
the environment.  
 
 
RECs beyond the Scope of ASTM 1527-05 and AAI 
1. Based on the age and construction of the building and on the Sanborn Fire Insurance maps, 
asbestos-containing building materials may be present in the 9 Lakeview Terrace building.  
However, it should be noted that a building permit from 1988 states “Asbestos siding 
removed 8/2/88”. 
 
Opinion:  If additional information is desired regarding the potential presence of asbestoscontaining
materials, then the services of a licensed inspector should be retained. 
 
2. Based on the age and construction of the building lead-based paint may be present in the 9 
Lakeview Terrace building. 
 
Opinion: If additional information is desired regarding the potential presence of leadbased
paint, then the services of a licensed inspector should be retained. 
 
3. Based on the age and construction of the building poly-chlorinated biphenyl (PCB) 
containing building materials may be present in the 9 Lakeview Terrace building. 
 
Opinion: If additional information is desired regarding the potential presence of PCBcontaining
materials, then the services of a licensed inspector should be retained. 
 
 
8.0 DATA GAPS/LIMITATIONS 
8.1 DATA GAPS 
 Snow cover present during the Site walkover prevented complete inspection of the 
exterior portions of the Site.  However, the conditions on this slope which could be observed 
were consistent with the observations of the previous Phase I ESA walkover.  Although not 
considered likely, it is possible that the snow cover was concealing item(s) of potential 
environmental concern. 
 
 The apartments were largely occupied, and therefore cabinets, drawers, etc. were not 
opened and inspected.  Based on the use of the apartments as living spaces, this data gap is not 
considered significant.  
 
 The roof and attic of the 9 Lakeview Terrace building were not accessed.  Other than the 
previously-identified concerns of asbestos-containing building materials and lead-based paint, it 
is considered unlikely that items of environmental concern are located in this space. 
 
8.2 LIMITATIONS 
The conclusions of this ESA were based upon information obtained and made available 
to The Johnson Company from the following sources:  Burlington Town Clerk; the Burlington  
Health Officer; the Burlington Fire Department; the Burlington Police Department, the VT DEC; 
the Federal EPA; Burlington College (property owner), and from information gathered during 
the Property reconnaissance.  This information has been intended for the sole use of Redstone for 
specific application to the Property at 9 Lakeview Terrace and 85 North Ave.  No other uses, 
expressed or implied, are warranted.  The design of the investigation was based on sound 
scientific techniques and experience with similar investigations.  Should additional information 
become available pertaining to environmental concerns that may be associated with the Property, 
the information should be made available to The Johnson Company so that we may re-evaluate 
our conclusions.
